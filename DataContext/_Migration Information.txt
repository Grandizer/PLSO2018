If you start getting the following message:
	Introducing FOREIGN KEY constraint 'FK_Tenant_Subscriber_SubscriberID' on table 'Tenant' may cause cycles or multiple cascade paths. Specify ON DELETE NO ACTION or ON UPDATE NO ACTION, or modify other FOREIGN KEY constraints.
	Could not create constraint. See previous errors.

	You can fix it by adding this code to the TenantMap (in this case) class:
		builder.HasOne(x => x.Subscriber).WithMany(x => x.Tenants)
			.IsRequired()
			.OnDelete(DeleteBehavior.Restrict);
